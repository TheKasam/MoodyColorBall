#  Moody Color Ball

Moody Color Ball is a iOS Game. You have to get the ball into the ring thats of the same color. This project was some free lance work I did for a client (May 2018). Did everything from Designing to Development. Was one of my first sprite kit games hence the code is not structured to well but over all makes for a fun game.

## Features
Multiple screens (Home, Game, and Continue), Animations, UserDefaults, Sprite Interactions (Sprite Kit) and SKScene and SKPhysics. App  works on the latest version of XCode
